# Note!

This is a repo clone of https://src.doom.fm/spotify-notifications/macOS on GitHub because I am lazy and wanted it here for forks and PRs.

## Spotify Notifications

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/citruspi/Spotify-Notifications.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/citruspi/Spotify-Notifications)

Spotify Notifications does nothing more than display a notification when:

- A song goes from "paused" to "playing" _(optional)_
- A new song is played
